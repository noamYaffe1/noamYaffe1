## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p align="left">
I'm Noam Yaffe, a cyber & tech enthusiast. Currently, I'm an application security researcher, and I also lecture about Secure Programming for developers at companies as a freelancer.
<br>
I started my journey on the computer at the age of 15, going from being a full-stack developer to penetration testing, red-team member, and vulnerability research (and from time to time also bug bounty, it is hard to resist after all...).
<br>
I mainly use Python to automate the exploit flow and Node JS to create backend-related infrastructure and API's.
