## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p align="left">
I'm Noam, a cyber & tech enthusiast.
<br>
Application security researcher || Red Teaming || Lecture about Secure Programming for developers at various companies
<br><br>
I started my journey on the computer at the age of 15, going from being a full-stack developer to penetration testing, red-team member, and vulnerability research (and from time to time also bug bounty, it is hard to resist after all...).
<br>
I mainly use Python to automate the daily repetitive work such as recon or scanning and use Node JS to create backend-related infrastructure and APIs when needed.
